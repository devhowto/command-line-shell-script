= Inspecting And Diffing
:page-subtitle: Git

== Added, Changed and Deleted Files !

Show deleted files on current branch vs what is in `origin/develop`:

[source,source]
----
git diff --name-status  origin/develop..HEAD | grep '^D' | wc -l
----

== Diff non-committed changes

Changes were made to `./intro.adoc`.
The following command displays what has changed on that file, no mater if it is staged or not:

[source,text]
----
$ git diff ./file.txt
----

For example, in the branch `devel`, `main.c` looks like this:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  fprintf(stderr, "Not implemented!\n");
  return 0;
}
----

The working tree is clean.
Then we edit `main.c` and make add this line (plus an empty line after it):

[source,c]
----
#define MAX_BYTES 0
----

Then, to see the diff of this non-committed, non-staged change:

[source,text]
----
$ git diff ./main.c
----

image::git-diff-changed.png[git diff changed]

[source,text]
----
$ git diff ./main.c
diff --git a/main.c b/main.c
index b3d9d56..83e2891 100644
--- a/main.c
+++ b/main.c
@@ -1,5 +1,7 @@
 #include <stdio.h>

+#define MAX_BYTES 8
+
 int main(void) {
   fprintf(stderr, "Not implemented!\n");
   return 0;
----

If the file has been staged (added to the index), then the `--staged` option is needed as well (otherwise we see no output, as if nothing was changed on the file):

[source,text]
----
$ git diff --staged ./main.c
----
