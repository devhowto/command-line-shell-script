== Save As

Sometimes one is working on incremental examples or code snippets like `solution_v1.c`, `solution_v2.c`, etc.

In vim, one can use `:saveas` to save the current buffer under a different name, so for example, to save the current buffer as `foo.txt` in the current directory, one can simply do:

.vim or nvim
[source,text]
----
:saveas ./foo.txt<CR>
----

And if we want to save under a different directory, simply start typing the directory name and tab-completing the paths:

.vim or nvim
[source,text]
----
:saveas ./exa<Bab>
:saveas ./examples/e<Tab>
:saveas ./examples/easy/foo.txt<CR>
----

At any moment, it is possible to type kbd:[Ctrl+d] to display the possible further completions.

So one can keep doing something like this:

.vim or nvim
[source,text]
----
:saveas ./C/<Ctrl+d>
:saveas ./C/po<Tab>
:saveas ./C/pointers/<Ctrl+d>
:saveas ./C/pointers/solution_v2.c
----

That is, using a healthy mix of kbd:[Tab] and kbd:[Ctrl+d] one can easily and quickly find a place to save files.

But we can do even better for this scenario!

If we just want to keep saving v2, v3, etc. files in a given directory where the current v1 file is currently being edited, we can use vim register `%` (current filename path) to shorten some steps.

One can insert a register into the command line (or inside the current buffer) with kbd:[Ctrl+r] followed by register name.
For example, kbd:[Ctrl+r %] will insert the current buffer name with its path relative the vim's CWD into the buffer or command line.

Suppose you are editing `./C/pointers/easy/example_1.c`, and you want to expand on that by making `example_2.c`.

First, save the current v1 as v2:

.vim or nvim
[source,text]
----
:saveas <Ctrl+r>%
----

At this point we would have:

[source,text]
----
:saveas /home/user/projs/C/pointers/example_1.c
----

Simply edit the 1 in `example_1.c` so that it looks like `example_2.c` and hit kbd:[Enter].
