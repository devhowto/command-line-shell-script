== Input data to sed

No need to do `cat` or `echo ... | sed ...` all the time.

[source,shell-session]

$ sed '' poem1.txt

$ sed '' < poem1.txt

$ < poem1.txt sed ''

== Print file contents

[source,shell-session]

$ cat file.txt
$ sed '' file.tx # <2>
$ sed -n p file.txt # <3>
$ sed -n '1,$ p' file.txt # <3>

1. Yeah, we could use `cat`.
2. Or use an empty command, which by default (and without `-n`) just outputs the contents of the pattern space.
3. Or using `-n` to avoid auto-printing of the pattern space and explicitly using the `p` command to print, which prints all the lines if no address is used.
4. Doing everything explicitly, that is, from line 1 to the last line, print.
